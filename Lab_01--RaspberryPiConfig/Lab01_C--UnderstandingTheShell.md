##Lab 1C. Understanding the Shell



From [Wikipedia, Shell (computing):](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing))
> A shell manages the userâ€“system interaction by prompting users for input, interpreting their input, and then handling an output from the underlying operating system.

#####The text-only command-line interface (CLI), commonly shortened to "command-line", is the simplest shell we will use in class.

Command-line utilizes a keyboard and video screen as the human-computer interface. It is also known as a terminal (think of the very ends of the cables connected to the computer), or shell (think of a wrapper -- a shell is a program which wraps or runs other programs).
	
You get a blinking prompt where you can enter commands, you submit the commands by typing \<enter>. Often you will get text sent back to you by the shell, as the output of your command.

The string of characters next to your blinking cursor is called the command prompt. It is the computer asking you for input in the form of a command and syntax that it has been programmed to recognize. Default on Pi for the command prompt is to show your username, the '@' symbol, and your short hostname, followed by the (abbreviated where possible) current directory in which your shell is located:

	pi@raspberrypi ~ $ _
		
The default command prompt will show a dollar sign (`$`) if you are a regular user, and a pound sign (`#`) sign if you are a superuser. We'll get to explain the superuser later.

One of the most important aspects of the shell, especially for new users, is that it has built in help files. You access help files for a given command using the 'man' command. As an 'argument' to this command, you need to submit the name of the command whose manual pages you would like to lookup, and then press \<enter> to submit your command for processing. Thankfully, the 'man' command has it's own helpfiles. Let's read them.

1. Using the command prompt, bring up the manual pages (often abbreviated as the 'man pages') for the man command itself:

		$ man man

	The screen will be cleared and you will be presented with the manual. Note that the manual continues off the screen. For getting help on using man pages, use the **`<h>`** key ('h' for 'help'). To scroll down one line at a time, use the **`<enter>`** key. To scroll down one entire page at a time, use the **`<space bar>`**. To go to the previous page, press the **`<b>`** key ('b' for 'back'). To exit out of the man pages, press the **`<q>`** key ('q' for 'quit').
		
	#####NOTE: Many man pages have a very helpful section way at their bottom entitled "EXAMPLES". This section often shows written commands with their explained output. Very handy!	
	
## Assignment


1. Read some more man pages (for the programs listed below), and take detailed notes. Use the Markdown format since it can be read easily by humans and easily converted into HTML by computers for nice rendered viewing online.

	On the Windows computer next to your Raspberry Pi, have your lab partner use the free editor with live rendering at:
	http://dillinger.io
	You can link it to google drive, dropbox, and github. Or you can edit and download the file.
	###CRITICAL NOTE: Anything you save to the desktop on the Windows computer will be deleted after you logout (Rice IT default setup for the Windows computers). So it's best to use online text editing to save your file. Email it to yourself for now so that you have a backup.


	As you read, write down general and specific usage notes about each command using Markdown format (*.md). Feel free to use a web browser on the neighboring PC to help you work through understanding these programs and how they are commonly used:

		man

		who
		whoami
		hostname
		passwd
		sudo
		su
		ps
		top
		uptime
		
		echo
		touch
		chown
		chmod
		chgrp
		crontab
		nano
		
		pwd
		ls
		dir
		mkdir
		cd
		
		cp
		mv
		rm

		bash
		dash
		sh
		ssh
		which
		clear
		
		cat
		sed
		grep
		more
		less
		head
		tail
		
		tar
		unzip
		wget
		ifconfig
		mount
		ping
		apt-get
		git
		python
		raspistill
		raspivid
		
		shutdown
		
		
1. Using your notes, answer the following questions. In your answers **be sure to indicate** the command(s) you used to arrive at your answer. One lab partner should run the Pi while the other helps advise using the notes you generated. Switch roles mid-way through these questions so you each get a feel for the terminal.

	1. What is your username?<br><br><br>
	1. What is your short hostname?<br><br><br>
	1. What is your IP Address?<br><br><br>
	1. What is the full path of your current working directory?<br><br><br>
	1. How long has your Pi been turned on?<br><br><br>
	1. What version of `python` is installed on your Pi?<br><br><br>
	1. How long does it take to get a `ping` from google.com? How many bytes did you get back? NOTE: you can quit pinging with **`<ctrl-C>`**<br><br><br>
	1. Where is the `man` command located on your hard drive?<br><br><br>
	1. What is the serial number of your Pi? (hint: it's stored in the `/proc/cpuinfo` file)<br><br><br>
	1. You want your Pi to take a photograph every hour. What program could you use to take the photograph? What program could schedule this command?<br><br><br>
	1. What command will let you reboot the Pi immediately?<br><br><br>
	1. What percentage of the CPU does the `top` command utilize?<br><br><br>

## Shutdown Procedure

1. Shutdown your Pi properly:

		$ sudo shutdown -h now

 Unplug everthing and restore the Windows desktop computer to a working state.

###Make sure you show your work to an Instructor before you leave for the day.
