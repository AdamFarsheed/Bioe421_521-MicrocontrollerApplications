AB  - The recent explosion in the diversity of available fluorescent proteins (FPs)
      promises a wide variety of new tools for biological imaging. With no unified
      standard for assessing these tools, however, a researcher is faced with difficult
      questions. Which FPs are best for general use? Which are the brightest? What
      additional factors determine which are best for a given experiment? Although in
      many cases, a trial-and-error approach may still be necessary in determining the 
      answers to these questions, a unified characterization of the best available FPs 
      provides a useful guide in narrowing down the options.

      Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein.
PG  - 1567-72
AB  - Fluorescent proteins are genetically encoded, easily imaged reporters crucial in 
      biology and biotechnology. When a protein is tagged by fusion to a fluorescent
      protein, interactions between fluorescent proteins can undesirably disturb
      targeting or function. Unfortunately, all wild-type yellow-to-red fluorescent
      proteins reported so far are obligately tetrameric and often toxic or disruptive.
      The first true monomer was mRFP1, derived from the Discosoma sp. fluorescent
      protein "DsRed" by directed evolution first to increase the speed of maturation, 
      then to break each subunit interface while restoring fluorescence, which
      cumulatively required 33 substitutions. Although mRFP1 has already proven widely 
      useful, several properties could bear improvement and more colors would be
      welcome. We report the next generation of monomers. The latest red version
      matures more completely, is more tolerant of N-terminal fusions and is over
      tenfold more photostable than mRFP1. Three monomers with distinguishable hues
      from yellow-orange to red-orange have higher quantum efficiencies.

AB  - All organic fluorophores undergo irreversible photobleaching during prolonged
      illumination. Although fluorescent proteins typically bleach at a substantially
      slower rate than many small-molecule dyes, in many cases the lack of sufficient
      photostability remains an important limiting factor for experiments requiring
      large numbers of images of single cells. Screening methods focusing solely on
      brightness or wavelength are highly effective in optimizing both properties, but 
      the absence of selective pressure for photostability in such screens leads to
      unpredictable photobleaching behavior in the resulting fluorescent proteins. Here
      we describe an assay for screening libraries of fluorescent proteins for enhanced
      photostability. With this assay, we developed highly photostable variants of
      mOrange (a wavelength-shifted monomeric derivative of DsRed from Discosoma sp.)
      and TagRFP (a monomeric derivative of eqFP578 from Entacmaea quadricolor) that
      maintain most of the beneficial qualities of the original proteins and perform as
      reliably as Aequorea victoria GFP derivatives in fusion constructs.

AB  - Visibly fluorescent proteins (FPs) from jellyfish and corals have revolutionized 
      many areas of molecular and cell biology, but the use of FPs in intact animals,
      such as mice, has been handicapped by poor penetration of excitation light. We
      now show that a bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans, incorporating
      biliverdin as the chromophore, can be engineered into monomeric,
      infrared-fluorescent proteins (IFPs), with excitation and emission maxima of 684 
      and 708 nm, respectively; extinction coefficient &gt;90,000 M(-1) cm(-1); and
      quantum yield of 0.07. IFPs express well in mammalian cells and mice and
      spontaneously incorporate biliverdin, which is ubiquitous as the initial
      intermediate in heme catabolism but has negligible fluorescence by itself.
      Because their wavelengths penetrate tissue well, IFPs are suitable for whole-body
      imaging. The IFPs developed here provide a scaffold for further engineering.
