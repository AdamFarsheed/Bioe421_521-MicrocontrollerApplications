#Rice University<br>Bioe 421/521: Microcontroller Applications
##Fall 2014
###Tues. 3-4 pm BRC 285; Thurs. 1-5 pm OEDK Computing Classroom
####Instructor: Jordan Miller<br>TA: Jacob Albritton

This class covers the usage of microcontrollers in a laboratory setting. We will start with basic software and command-line interfaces and design, program, and build systems utilizing widely-available microcontrollers (e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi). Units in motion control, sensors (light, temperature, humidity, UV/Vis absorbance), and actuation (pneumatics, gears, and motors) will provide students with functional knowledge to design and prototype their own experimental systems for laboratory-scale automation. **BIOE 521 students will be expected to complete a term paper.**


In this repo you will find instructions and assigments for class.

1. Fork this repo for your group.

1. Create a **new branch** for your work (**don't work in 'master'**)

1. Make use of tags to mark your work, turn in your homework each week using a single pull request. Your homework branch needs to use the following naming convention:
		
	team01-LightBender  (use your own team number and team name)
