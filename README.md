# Rice University<br>Bioe 421/521: Microcontroller Applications
#### Instructor: Jordan Miller

This class covers the usage and application of microcontrollers to solve discrete problems in a laboratory setting. We will utilize and build systems with widely-available low cost microcontrollers that have a rich community and online examples: namely, Arduino and Raspberry Pi. We begin by first learning command-line interaction and programming with the Linux operating system on Raspberry Pi. We then move on to using Linux and Raspberry Pi to program connected Arudino boards and their derivatives. We will also utilize the “Circuit Playground” board from Adafruit. Units in text processing, web scraping, thread looping, and working with sensors (light, temperature, sound) and signals (LEDs, buttons, speakers) provide a critical foundation toward building useful devices. Additional opportunities in motion control and actuation (pneumatics, gears, and motors) will provide students with additional functional knowledge. Ultimately, students will design and prototype their own experimental systems for laboratory- scale automation. **BIOE 521 students will be expected to complete a term paper.**
