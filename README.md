#Rice University<br>Bioe 421/521: Microcontroller Applications
##Fall 2015
###Tues. 2-3 pm BRC 282; Thurs. 1-5 pm OEDK Computing Classroom Room 112
####Instructor: Jordan Miller<br>TA: Dan Sazer

This class covers the usage of microcontrollers in a laboratory setting. We will start with basic software and command-line interfaces and design, program, and build systems utilizing widely-available microcontrollers (e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi). Units in motion control, sensors (light, temperature, humidity, UV/Vis absorbance), and actuation (pneumatics, gears, and motors) will provide students with functional knowledge to design and prototype their own experimental systems for laboratory-scale automation. **BIOE 521 students will be expected to complete a term paper.**


In this repo you will find instructions and assigments for class.

1. Fork this repo for your group.
